# Stories for your site

## Main Feautures

Stories with progress bar and controls like WhatsApp Stories: slider with tumbnails, play + pause + sounud on/off controls, progress bar, auto closing after last video ends

### Defaults for video

Autoplay, muted

### Dependencies

If you need to use swiper for previews - use local (included) or cdn versions of [swiper slider](https://swiperjs.com)

### How to

Copy the code into your project. Mb later (never) i'll make it better, but not now...

For php to js object use json_encode for array

```
array(
  array(
    'id' => 0,
	'imageUrl' => 'https',
	'videoUrl' => 'https',
	'anotherData' => ''
  ),
);
